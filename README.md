Hello, I’m [@pyglot](https://twitter.com/pyglot).

IRL I do IC design (analog, digital, mixed, layout and some mgt). In the metaverse I am mostly interested in learning software development and creating apps/dapps, software and tools. 

I'm also interested in the the direction blockchain technology and cryptocurrencies might transform society. I think when government realizes what a powerful tool it is it will be used everywhere, but not quite on today's terms. 

When it comes to programming I am most comfortable with python at the moment, hence my name `py`-`glot`. 
I am not really a `poly`-`glot` but I also did some minor stuff in smartPy, c, c++, javascript, GLSL, java, pascal, basic, assembler, sql, php, perl, vhdl, verilog, systemverilog. 

Back in the day I used to love music trackers [(example)](https://www.stef.be/bassoontracker/?file=demomods%2Fhoffman_and_daytripper_-_professional_tracker.mod).
I've also spent some hours on making software for computer generated art. I made a tool to create pictures based on genetic programming. 
You can see some of the images it output here (https://opensea.io/pyglot). Then I got into GLSL shaders which are wayyy more suited for that kind of thing so I probably have to remake my tool as a dapp... 

At the moment I am interested in learning front-end development because I have some web based dapp ideas. I have a gap in my knowledge when it comes to front-end stuff.
